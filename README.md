#Decisions
- CDN: I am using Angular from Google's CDN.
- One file for each kind of dependency(one controller, another for filters, and so it goes...): This is a sample project. Depending on the size of your project, you might wanna go for separate files for each controller, service or whatsoever.
- Less comments, more code readability: I strongly believe that your code should speak for itself.
- Guidelines: I'll do my best to use <a href="http://cssguidelin.es/">these</a> CSS Guidelines
